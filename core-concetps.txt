What is the Go, and what are the use case

what things i need to run go code?

Data types - string, integers, booleans, array and slices, maps, Structs

Variables and Constraints

Formatted Output

Getting and validating user input

Pointers

Variables scope

Loops

If else & switch

Functions

Organise code in go packages

Goroutines to make our app faster

Go programming language developed at Google in 2007.

Open sourced in 2009.

why another programming language?
What is the purpose?
how is it better or different?

All our code should belong to a package.

where to start executing go application.
so we have to give an entry point to start a go application.

because when we run go application, we need main starting point for execution.
where to start the program? where is the entrypoint?

if we have multiple files in project, we need to give go compiler a starting point, the first line of code where the execution start.


entrypoint is a main function, which go compiler will look whenever we execute our go application. 


Each language use case can be different.

But the basics remain same.

Like data types
declaring Variables
Operators
Looping
Conditional Statement
Comments
Printing output
Taking output from user
